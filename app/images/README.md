# Icons

The icon master image, icon.xfc, is generated from Lorc's Awesome SVG icons.

Favicons were moved under source control to make deployment easier.

## Editing Notes

Special care has been taken to ensure that background remains transparent to avoid nastyness around solid background favicon which differing tab colors. GIMP makes this trivial.

Icons can be regenerated by visiting [faviconit](http://faviconit.com/) which provides sane favicon generation.
