There are a ton of awesome MTG sites out there. Detailed pricing, decks across each format, coverage archives, blogs, collection tracking, online trading, and so many more have become pillars of the community.

Well, here's preorda.in. I've been working on versions of the site for a awhile.

It took a few months to get to a collection tracker. **It was awful, so I scrapped it.**

Some months later, another collection tracker but a focus on card and set pages. It was much better. **It was also slow and about as stable as the limited meta; I scraped it.**

Now? Cut down to the core of a [set list](https://preorda.in/sets), [set galleries](https://preorda.in/set/Battle%20for%20Zendikar), and [card pages](https://preorda.in/card/Cryptic%20Command), things are starting to feel really good. However, it doesn't do anything that isn't done by dozens of other sites. **That's where you come in.**

## Let me know what you want

Here's a survey, it's short. I want preorda.in to have a niche, you decide which one it fills. Open until November 22.
