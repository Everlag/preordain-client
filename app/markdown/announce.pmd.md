# The survey

The survey was a grand success! I had 102 responses, mostly from [r/mtgfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance).

## Niches

Keep in mind that 2 niches could've been chosen and that the niches were fairly asymmetric-- some could be features of others.

1. The majority wanted price analytics in the niche. Given the majority traffic source, that's not surprising.

1. The other large niche chosen was Blogs and Videos. Apparently the Magic community loves blogs. I mean, there are a ton of [awesome](http://blog.mtgprice.com/) [sites](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/) [out](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChannelFireball/videos) there doing quality work that I enjoy.

## Support

The majority of people wanted ads, probably because its zero effort to support an ad based site apart from enjoying the content.

Patreon was the second most popular, by a large margin. I love the idea of Patreon as it provides a more stable and 'clean' source of revenue than ads.

## Specific Comments

23 people proposed a variety of comments ranging from reminders not to forget a specific part of a niche to complete descriptions of desired features.

There's a few I'd specifically like to paraphrase. If yours isn't here, that doesn't mean I dislike like it or disagree with it, I just want to publicly address these as they came up multiple times.

> *'Something unique, don't waste time reinventing the wheel'*

> *'Something that already exists but way better'*

The Magic market is crowded. People have done collection managers, blogs, trade trackers, online trading, price analytics, deckbuilding, forums, videos, and basically everything else. Some sites are so awesome at what they do that competing is impossible; some sites get you so locked into their service that you can't easily switch; some sites have just cornered the niche, they're synonymous with the it.

> *'An alternative to Reddit as a Magic hub'*

I love Reddit, it lets an incredible amount of people share their content easily and to a wide and, arguably, diverse audience. However, Reddit doesn't do extremely high quality or diverse, inline media well.

# What now?

I've taken a break. Not a terribly long one for the six months I've been on the project but long enough to let me mull over the ideas presented in the survey.

Several routes are apparent, I'm feeling out which are technically doable right now. For now, the core feels good, I want to make the next step feel better.
